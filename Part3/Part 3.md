1. To install git you need to make sure its available on your computer, if you already have it make sure its up to date. Once Git is installed follow the instructions provided in the Git Setup wizard until the installation is complete. 
If you have issues in downloading or installing Git Hub you can get further information here:

2. Best practises for repositories include:
Create a README file for every repository as it helps people to navigate you work and communicates expectations for your project and helps manage contributions.
Branching over forking : It is recommended that collaborators work from a single repository, creating pull requests between branchs instead of between repositories.

Git Flow Branch strategy:
The main idea behind the Git flow branching strategy is to isolate your work into different types of branches. There are five different branch types in total:

Main
Develop
Feature
Release
Hotfix
The two primary branches in Git flow are main and develop. There are three types of supporting branches with different intended purposes: feature, release, and hotfix.
