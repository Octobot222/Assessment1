I added some text to the pull request. At the bottom of the page you can see I have written YOOO and also that i like cats.

On GitHub, you can view the commit history of a repository in two main ways:

Navigating directly to the commits page of a repository:

Go to the repository's main page on GitHub.
Click on the "Commits" tab near the top of the page.
This will display a list of commits, typically showing the most recent commits first.
Clicking on a file, then clicking History to get to the commit history for a specific file:

Navigate to the file you're interested in within the repository.
Click on the file to open it.
At the top right corner of the file view, click on the "History" button.
This will display the commit history specifically for that file, showing changes made to it over time.
These methods allow you to explore the commit history of a GitHub repository either as a whole or for individual files within it.
