1. Mercurial, Git and Apache Subversion
2. One of the main advantages of using GIT is its branching capabilities, this can make sure that production quality code and production code are kept separate and then can merge later. You can also use pull requests to merge your work with someone elses. Git is also open source which is important because it invites developers from all around the world to contribute
3. A branch is a split off from your main development where you can make changes without affecting your main workings. A pull is where you get access to someone elses repository, make changes and then merge them back. A push is where you take the changes yove done on your local repository and push them onto git Hub. A repository is an essential place for storing files, code and each files revision history. Working copy clones a Git repository which can then be edited, previewed and committed. A git merge lets you take different branches and integrate them into a single branch.

4. copyright, privacy and OHS policies and procedures might need Git 

5. You can use Git's inbuilt mergetool, or VS Code built in merge tool or git diff 
6. To check for merge conflicts you can view a list of the files with conflicting changes above the merge pull request button.

 7. In order to fix merge conflicts follow these steps:
 
    click pull requests
 
    click the pull requet that has a merge conflict
    
    click resolve conflicts

    decide which branchs you want to keep

    delete the conflict markers (<<<<< ======>>>>>) and make any changes you want.

    click mark as resolved

    click commit merge 

    click merge pull request

8. git revert creates a new commit that is the opposite of an existing commit. So if you added a line revert will delete the line.

9. reset is the command we use when we want to move the repository back to a previous commit, discarding any changes made after that commit.

10. Unlike git reset, which modifies the project history, git revert creates a new commit that effectively cancels out the changes made in the target commit, preserving the history while reverting the changes.

11. False

12. True

13. DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a set of practices, methodologies, and cultural philosophies aimed at improving collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. 
It can allow game developers to iterate on their games more rapidly. Automated testing, continuous integration, and continuous deployment enable faster feedback loops, leading to quicker identification and resolution of bugs and issues.

14. Some commonly used tools with Git Hub can include:
- Jenkins: This is an open source automation server used for testing, building and deploying software. it helps to suppoert continuous integration and delivery pipelines which allows developers to automate various stages of the softwre development lifecycle.
- Git: This version control system enables collaboration among developers as it tracks changes to code during its development.
Docker: is a containerization platform that allows developers to package appluctions and their dependencies into containers. 

15. CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery that are practises aimed at automating the process of integrating code changes, testing them and delivering them to production environments. 
Continuous integration is useful for developers as developers frequently commit changes to a shared repository.
Continuous Delivery is used in the staging environment where changes undergo testing, to ensure they meet quality standards.
CI/CD can be used to create faster release cycles as automated testing and deployment enable developers to release new features and updates more regularly.
